Twisted dropped support for pyOpenSSL < 16.0.0 in Twisted 16.4.0 release (see http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/ticket/8441); in fact it worked for some time, but they recently removed some of the supporting code as well. Is upgrading it an option? You can check pyOpenSSL version by running python -c 'import OpenSSL; print(OpenSSL.version.__version__)'

sudo pip install --upgrade pyopenssl
scrapy startproject craigslist (works fine now)

cd craigslist
